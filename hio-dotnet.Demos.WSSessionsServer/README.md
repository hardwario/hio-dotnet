
# WSSession Server
This application creates session and transfer data over websocket to provide remote access to the console of HARDWARIO Monitor. 

It is kind of minimalistic server. 
The websockets might be replaced with the MQTT later.

The feature is accessible from both [Hardwario Monitor MAUI](/hio-dotnet.Demos.HardwarioMonitor) and [Hardwario Monitor WASM](/hio-dotnet.Demos.BlazorComponents.RadzenLib.WASM/).
